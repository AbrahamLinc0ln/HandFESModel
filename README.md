# HandFESModel
Model of grip forces resulting from functional electrical stimulation applied to the forearm

twitchSummationModel: Calculates grip forces given models of twitches and force-amplitude curve. Twitches are modeled as a radial basis function. The force-amplitude curve is model by a sigmoid. These models are included in the script and have adjustable parameters. 

Future commits will change the script to be a function for use in an MPC model.
